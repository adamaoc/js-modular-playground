# js-modular-playground

Playing around with `JavaScript` modules and modular patterns.

In the `modular-patern` folder you'll find a few different basic patterns like Object Literal.

Taking it to the next level, the `webpack-intro` folder uses the same code converting the modules to `ES6` modules and using `webpack` to compile the world.

I plan on adding extra as I go. If you stumble upon this repo and you have questions or want more explained, please feel free to reach out.
